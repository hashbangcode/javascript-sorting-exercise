# Javascript Sorting Algorithms Exercise

This 

## Requirements

You must be running at least node version 14.0 to allow the Jest testing library to work.

## Files

- bubleSort.js - A file ready to have the bubble sort algorithm implemented.
- quickSort.js - A file ready to have the quick sort algorithm implemented.
__test__ - A directory containing test files. The testData.js file is used to store testing data.

## Usage

Open up the exercise in your text editor of choice. You will see that the core of the functions in the *Sort.js files are empty.

Run the tests for the package by running the command `npm run test`. This will show you that the tests are failing.

You can run `npm run test-bubble`, and `npm run test-quick` to run the tests for a single sorting algorithm.

Write the sorting algorithms in the function, this should take an array as an argument and return the same array with sorted numbers.

Once everything is working you will be able to run `npm run test` and see a set of passing tests.

## Eslint

Eslint has been added to the package to allow users doing the exercise to ensure they are following best practice.

Run `npm run eslint` to check the coding styles of the package.

Run `npm run eslint-fix` to fix many simple coding style problems like incorrect whitespace.
